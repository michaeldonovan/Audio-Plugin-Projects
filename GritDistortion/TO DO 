Add distortion type selector -- four buttons below the drive knob?
ditch the biquads, they cause weird artifacts
put clip level on a fader, add bypass
probably get rid of shape/kAmount -- default it to middle value

Oversampling??

Clip level antialiasing/parameter smoothing?

knob shape for gain knob?

auto gain compensation

remove units when you make your own level meter :)

add light to indicate that clipper is on/have it come on when level is set to <= -0.1dB

Check shape/amount values for soft sat

calculate gain depending on dist algo

Popping when bypass/engaged?

fix mix ratio

phase issues with mix - fix by delaying dry by getLatency()?
